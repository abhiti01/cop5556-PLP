## Overview
This project was completed as part of the course curriculum for COP 5556 Programming Language Principles at the University of Florida. It represents a comprehensive exploration of fundamental programming language concepts, offering a hands-on experience in language design and compiler development.

### Project Objective
The core objective of this project is to develop a programming language and a corresponding compiler by delving into critical areas of language design, lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic analysis, and code execution.

### Key Project Components

- **Compiler Development**: At the heart of the project lies the creation of a compiler that can execute programs written in the custom language. This involves parsing source code, performing semantic analysis, and executing programs, offering insights into the inner workings of programming languages.

- **Testing and Evaluation**: The `test` directory contains a comprehensive set of test cases and sample programs. These tests help ensure the compiler's accuracy and robustness in handling diverse language constructs.

## Project Structure
- **src**: Source code for the custom programming language and compiler.
- **test**: Test cases and sample programs for evaluating the compiler.
