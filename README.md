## Overview
This project was completed as part of the course curriculum for COP 5556 Programming Language Principles at the University of Florida. It represents an exploration of fundamental programming language concepts, design and compiler development.

### Project Objective
Develop a programming language and a corresponding compiler by diving into critical areas of language design, lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic analysis, and code execution.

### Key Project Components

- **Compiler Development**: Core of the project is a compiler that can execute programs written in the custom language. This involves parsing source code, performing semantic analysis, and executing programs, offering insights into the inner workings of programming languages.

- **Testing and Evaluation**: The `test` directory contains a comprehensive set of test cases and sample programs. These tests help ensure the compiler's accuracy and robustness in handling diverse language constructs.

## Project Structure
- **src**: Source code for the custom programming language and compiler.
- **test**: Test cases and sample programs for evaluating the compiler.
