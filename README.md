# COP5556 Programming Language Principles - Fall '22

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the course curriculum for COP 5556 Programming Language Principles at the University of Florida. It represents a comprehensive exploration of fundamental programming language concepts, offering a hands-on experience in language design and interpreter development.

### Project Objective
The core objective of this project is to develop a bespoke programming language and a corresponding interpreter by delving into critical areas of language design, lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic analysis, and code execution.

### Key Project Components
- **Language Design**: This project provides an opportunity to craft a new programming language from the ground up. You can experiment with unique syntax, grammar, and semantics, and explore various programming paradigms.

- **Interpreter Development**: At the heart of the project lies the creation of an interpreter that can execute programs written in the custom language. This involves parsing source code, performing semantic analysis, and executing programs, offering insights into the inner workings of programming languages.

- **Testing and Evaluation**: The `test` directory contains a comprehensive set of test cases and sample programs. These tests help ensure the interpreter's accuracy and robustness in handling diverse language constructs.

## Project Structure
- **src**: Source code for the custom programming language and interpreter.
- **test**: Test cases and sample programs for evaluating the interpreter.
